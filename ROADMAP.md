# Latgaliana Programming Language Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features, enhancements, and future directions for the `Latgaliana` programming language. It provides an overview of the upcoming milestones and goals for the project.

## Short-term Goals (next 6 months)

- Implement basic syntax and language constructs, including variables, functions, and control flow statements.
- Develop a lexer and parser for the `Latgaliana` language.
- Build a simple compiler to generate executable code.
- Create a standard library with essential utility functions and data structures.
- Establish a test suite for ensuring language correctness and stability.
- Provide basic tooling support, including code formatting and syntax highlighting.

## Medium-term Goals (6 to 12 months)

- Enhance the language with advanced features such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Implement support for modules and package management.
- Improve the error handling and debugging capabilities of `Latgaliana`.
- Develop a standard library with a comprehensive set of modules for common programming tasks.
- Integrate with existing development tools and frameworks to facilitate seamless integration and adoption.
- Explore possibilities for cross-platform development and interoperability with other languages and runtimes.

## Long-term Goals (beyond 12 months)

- Enhance performance and optimize the execution speed of `Latgaliana` programs.
- Extend `Latgaliana` with advanced language features like generics and metaprogramming.
- Build a robust ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools around `Latgaliana`.
- Foster a vibrant community around `Latgaliana` through documentation, tutorials, and community events.
- Support additional platforms and environments, such as mobile and web development.
- Explore opportunities for formal language specification and standardization.

Please note that the roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback, emerging technologies, and evolving programming trends. We are open to suggestions and contributions from the community to shape the future of `Latgaliana`.
