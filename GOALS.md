# Latgaliana Programming Language Goals

Latgaliana is a modern programming language inspired by the culture and language of Latgale, the historical region of Latvia. The following are the goals and principles that drive the development of Latgaliana:

## Goals

1. **Simplicity and Readability**: Make Latgaliana easy to read, write, and understand. Strive for a clean and intuitive syntax that reduces verbosity and promotes code clarity.

2. **Expressiveness and Productivity**: Enable developers to express their ideas concisely and efficiently in Latgaliana. Provide powerful language constructs and features that facilitate rapid development and increased productivity.

3. **Strong Typing and Safety**: Emphasize strong typing to catch errors at compile-time and enhance code reliability. Enforce type safety to prevent common programming mistakes and promote code robustness.

4. **Interoperability**: Ensure seamless interoperability with existing JavaScript code and libraries. Enable developers to leverage the extensive JavaScript ecosystem while benefiting from the modern features and syntax of Latgaliana.

5. **Modern Features**: Incorporate modern language features inspired by successful programming languages like Kotlin, C#, and C++. Include concepts such as null safety, lambdas, coroutines, pattern matching, and object-oriented programming to empower developers and promote code reuse.

6. **Performance**: Optimize the execution speed of Latgaliana programs to ensure efficient runtime performance. Explore opportunities for compilation optimizations and runtime improvements to deliver fast and responsive applications.

7. **Extensibility**: Design Latgaliana with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to create their own domain-specific languages (DSLs) or extend the language itself through metaprogramming capabilities. Enable the creation of reusable libraries and frameworks that enhance Latgaliana's functionality.

8. **Tooling Support**: Provide comprehensive tooling support for Latgaliana, including code editors with syntax highlighting and code completion, a command-line interface for compiling and running code, and debugging capabilities. Offer developer-friendly error messages and diagnostics to aid in debugging and development.

## Principles

The development of Latgaliana is guided by the following principles:

- **Simplicity**: Strive for simplicity in design and implementation. Avoid unnecessary complexity and prioritize intuitive and straightforward solutions. Make the language accessible to developers of all skill levels.

- **Community-driven**: Foster a collaborative and inclusive community around Latgaliana. Encourage open discussions, feedback, and contributions from the community to shape the language's development and ensure it meets the needs of its users. Value diverse perspectives and encourage active participation.

- **Documentation and Learning**: Provide comprehensive and user-friendly documentation, tutorials, and learning resources to support developers in adopting and mastering Latgaliana. Offer clear and concise explanations of language concepts, best practices, and usage examples. Promote a culture of continuous learning.

- **Compatibility**: Promote compatibility with existing industry standards and conventions to ensure smooth integration with other tools, frameworks, and libraries. Strive for interoperability with established technologies to facilitate the adoption and usage of Latgaliana within existing software ecosystems.

- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Design Latgaliana to be flexible and extensible. Allow developers to customize and extend the language to suit their specific needs, whether through DSLs or language extensions. Encourage the development of reusable libraries and frameworks that enhance the functionality and capabilities of Latgaliana.

- **Reliability and Performance**: Prioritize reliability and performance in the design and implementation of Latgaliana. Aim for robustness, stability, and efficient execution of programs. Implement optimizations where appropriate to deliver high-performance applications.
