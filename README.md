# Latgaliana Programming Language

Welcome to the `Latgaliana` programming language! `Latgaliana` is a modern programming language inspired by the culture and language of Latgale, the historical region of Latvia. It aims to provide a user-friendly and expressive syntax while incorporating features from Kotlin, C#, and C++.

## Features

- **Simplicity and Readability:** `Latgaliana` emphasizes a clean and intuitive syntax, making it easy for developers to write and understand code. It focuses on reducing verbosity and providing concise constructs.

- **Strong Typing:** `Latgaliana` incorporates strong typing to enhance code reliability and catch errors at compile-time. It provides static type checking to ensure type safety and improve code robustness.

- **Interoperability:** `Latgaliana` is designed to seamlessly interoperate with existing JavaScript code and libraries. This allows developers to leverage the extensive JavaScript ecosystem while benefiting from the modern features and syntax of `Latgaliana`.

- **Modern Syntax:** `Latgaliana` borrows from the best aspects of Kotlin, C#, and C++ to offer a modern and expressive syntax. It includes features like null safety, lambdas, coroutines, pattern matching, and object-oriented programming concepts to enable efficient and concise code development.
