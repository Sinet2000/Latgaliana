# Phase 1 - Foundational Setup

This initial phase of development focuses on establishing the foundational elements of the Latgaliana programming language.

## Goals

- Set up the basic infrastructure for the language development.
- Define the language specification, including its syntax, grammar, and semantics.
- Implement the lexer and parser to tokenize the source code and construct an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Design the AST representation and establish the foundation for subsequent phases of development.
- Lay the groundwork for the symbol table and type system, which will be developed in later phases.

## Tasks

1. **Language Specification**: Define the language specification for Latgaliana, documenting its syntax, grammar, and semantics. This specification will serve as a reference guide throughout the development process.

2. **Lexer and Parser**: Implement a lexer and parser to break down the Latgaliana source code into tokens and construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) based on the language's grammar rules. The lexer will tokenize the input code, and the parser will analyze the token stream to build the AST.

3. **AST Representation**: Design and implement a data structure to represent the AST, capturing the hierarchical structure of the Latgaliana code. This will serve as an intermediate representation for subsequent analysis and transformation steps.

4. **Symbol Table (Work in Progress)**: Begin laying the foundation for the symbol table, which will store and manage information about identifiers defined within the Latgaliana program. This initial phase may involve setting up the basic data structures and laying out the structure for subsequent development.

5. **Type System (Work in Progress)**: Lay the groundwork for the type system, which will define the supported data types, type inference rules, and type checking mechanisms in Latgaliana. This phase may involve initial research and planning for the type system's implementation.

## Next Steps

Once this foundational setup is complete, the development can progress to subsequent phases, which will involve expanding the language features, refining the symbol table and type system, and building the compiler or interpreter for Latgaliana.

This marks the completion of the first phase, the foundational setup, for the development of Latgaliana. Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to build upon this foundation.
